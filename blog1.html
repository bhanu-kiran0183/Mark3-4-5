    <h3>Gir Wildlife Sanctuary</h3>
    <br> 
    <p> As the only home of the Asiatic lion, you really don’t need any other reason to visit Gir Wildlife Sanctuary. It is a must see place if you are in Gujarat. Marked as one of the largest province for Asiatic lions, the area is well protected due to the great stretch of vegetation and other species residing in this sanctuary. The king of the jungle reigns supreme here, but there are plenty of other reasons to visit Gir, hyenas, leopards and over 250 species of birds just to name a few.​.</p>

    <h3>Patan & Modhera</h3>
    <br> 
    <p>Both these towns can be easily visited from Ahmedabad within a few hours. Another example of the Solanki period architecture can be seen in the Anahilwada Patan. It is also famous for its patola sarees and one of the most exquisite step wells in India, the Rani-ki-Vav.
