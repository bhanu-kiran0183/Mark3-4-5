    <h3>Charminar</h3>
    <br>    
    <p>Hyderabad’s most iconic landmark, Charminar is a notable monument and mosque that reflects the Indo-Islamic architecture of its times. Constructed of granite and limestone, at each of the four cardinal corners of the monument are 56-metere high ornate minarets with double balconies. Stairs lead to the second level, which is also where the open-air mosque is. The archways of the Charminar open out on to the streets for a panoramic view.​ </p>

    <h3>Hussain Sagar Lake</h3>
    <br> 
    <p> An oasis in the heart of Hyderabad, the Hussain Sagar Lake is named after Hussain Shah Wali. The main attraction at this manmade lake is an 18-metre high, 450-tonne statue of Buddha in the centre. Carved out of white granite that took two years to complete, it virtually glows especially on a full moon night. Hussain Sagar Lake is also popular for boating and along its periphery are other famous city attractions including Lumbini Park and Birla Mandir​.</p>

With four drawbridges, over 80 bastions, several temples, mosques, halls and royal residences, it’s nothing short of majestic. While most of it stands in ruins, hints of its past grandiose can be seen within its enclosures boasting of Mughal style architecture.</p>
